These Rules shall govern any other relations between the bookmaker Betriders and the customer. These Rules shall apply to betting on the website and at Betriders betting facilities.</p>
        <p>1. Bet is a risk-driven agreement for potential winnings entered into between the customer and the bookmaker under the established Rules, where the fulfillment of such agreement is conditioned by an event whose outcome is yet to be determined. Bets are accepted on the conditions offered by the bookmaker.</p>
        <p>2. Outcome is the result of the event (events) on which the bet was placed.</p>
        <p>3. Customer is an individual placing a bet with the bookmaker on an outcome.</p>
        <p>4. Bet Cancellation is an outcome on which the bet is not settled and winnings are not paid. As per the Rules, in the event of “bet cancellation”, an arrangement between the bookmaker and the customer shall be deemed unconcluded and the stake shall be refunded.</p>
        <p>5. Regular Time is the duration of the match subject to the regulations of the relevant sport, including time added by the referee. Regular time does not include extra time, overtime(s), penalty shootouts, etc.</p>
        <h4>Exchange Rules and Regulations</h4>
        <p>The Betriders Exchange Rules and Regulations ("Exchange Rules") are part of Betriders 's terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the Market Information or the Specific Sports Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail. If there is any inconsistency between the Market Information and either the General Rules or the Specific Sports Rules, the Market Information shall prevail, except where the General Rules or Specific Sports Rules use the phrase 'regardless of what it says in the Market Information' or similar wording.</p>
        <p>For any category or market not referred to in the Specific Sports Rules (e.g. 'Special Bets' or beach volleyball), the General Rules and Market Information will apply.</p>
        <p>Please note that there are separate Rules and Regulations for each of our Exchange and other products. The rules governing how markets are offered, managed and/or settled are not the same for every market on each product. In certain circumstances, a bet that is settled as a winner on one product may be settled as a loser on the other product (and vice versa). Additionally, different settlement rules may apply so that, for example, bets that are a winner on one product may be settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product. Customers must ensure that they familiarize themselves with the relevant rules that apply to the bets that they place on Betriders 's products.</p>
        <h4>General rules</h4>
        <p>10% comission is charged on total win (Profit) amount. This rules is applied for only Exchange Bets.</p>
        <p>For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but Betriders fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then:</p>
        <p>If the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void</p>
        <p>If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, FairExchange will use its reasonable endeavors to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by Betriders will be void</p>
        <p>For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but Betriders fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official 'off' time will be void.</p>
        <p>Betriders aims to use its reasonable endeavors to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However, regardless of what it says in the Market Information, Betriders does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.</p>
        <p>Betriders will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange market that has been turned in-play.</p>
        <p>All customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.</p>
        <p>For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that transmissions described as "live" by some broadcasters may actually be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.</p>
        <p>The availability of an in-play market on our Exchange product for a particular event does not necessarily mean that there will be an equivalent in-play market for the same event on our other products.</p>
        <p>All bets placed in the system are the clients responsibility. Any miss bets due to software glitch or website maintenance will not be Betriders responsibility and clients have to bear any or such losses incurred during this downtime.</p>
        <p>All markets other than soccer markets - not suspending at the time of the 'off'</p>
        <p>In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play, Betriders aims to use its reasonable endeavors to turn such markets in-play at the time of the 'off'. However, Betriders does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at the time of the 'off'.</p>
        <p>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but Betriders fails to suspend the market at the time of the 'off' and the market is not turned in-play at any time during the event, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off' will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the official rather than the scheduled 'off' time) UNLESS it can be established that the bet was placed before the official off time or the actual time of the off. If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, Betriders will use its reasonable endeavors to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by Betriders will be void.</p>
        <p>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but Betriders fails to suspend the market at the time of the 'off', but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the time of the 'off' will stand HOWEVER the price may be adjusted by Betriders and the bets may be settled accordingly to Betriders prices. Change of venue</p>
        <p>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply:</p>
        <p>For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after a bet is placed, all bets will be void only if the new venue is a home ground of the original away team.</p>
        <p>For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled venue is changed after a bet is placed, all bets will stand.</p>
        <p>If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a hockey match switching from grass to astro-turf) after a bet is placed, all bets will stand.</p>
        <p>Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements</p>
        <p>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules in relation to abandonment, cancellation and/or postponement the following shall apply.</p>
        <p>In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race or similar: If the event is not completed within three days after the scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets for this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.</p>
        <p>In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event is not completed within three days after the scheduled completion date of the event, then any markets relating to the event will be settled in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant governing body, providing such a decision is given within 90 days after the scheduled completion date. If no official ruling is announced in this 90 day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be void, except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to Betriders customers, then such part-settled bets will be reversed and all bets on the market will be void.</p>
        <p>If there is no further sporting action in any market that does not contain the selection 'draw' or 'tie', all bets placed after this conclusion of action will be voided.</p>
        <p>Betriders will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar). Results and market settlement</p>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>Where the Specific Sports Rules do not specify how and on what basis a market will be settled, markets will be settled on the official result of the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting the result).</p>
        <p>If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the result will be determined by Betriders (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then Betriders shall (acting reasonably) determine either:</p>
        <p>Whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new information</p>
        <p>Whether or not to wait for further information before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except where Betriders has announced that it is waiting for further information, any information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be considered by Betriders (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a different result).</p>
        <p>In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential result, Betriders reserves the right to suspend settlement of any market for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of Betriders . Betriders reserves the right to void any market if the uncertainty regarding settlement cannot be resolved to Betriders 's reasonable satisfaction.</p>
        <h4>Resettlements</h4>
        <p>Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in question. Betriders may settle (or part-settle) some markets before the official result is declared (or may increase a customer's 'available to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of that customer on a given market) purely as a customer service benefit. However, Betriders reserves the right to amend the settlement of the market if:</p>
        <p>The official result is different to the result on which Betriders initially settled the market (for example, a horseracing result being changed by the relevant governing body shortly after a race)</p>
        <p>If the whole market is eventually voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).</p>
        <p>Betriders reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical error).</p>
        <p>If Betriders resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a customer's balance to reflect changes in market settlement.</p>
        <h4>Non Runners</h4>
        <p>Unless stated otherwise in respect of any particular market, all bets are 'all in compete or not'. This means that if an individual or team is withdrawn or disqualified before they have taken part in the event bets on the selection will be deemed losers. However if the event specifically says it is 'non-runner no bet' stakes will be refunded if there is a withdrawal prior to the event. In the case of withdrawals we may apply a 'Tattersalls rule 4 deduction' to any winnings based upon the price of the withdrawn selection(s).</p>
        <h4>Specific Sports Rules</h4>
        <p>The specific Sports Rules will follow all rules as specify in Betriders website.</p>
        <h4>IRREGULAR BETS</h4>
        <p>The Operator reserves the right to refuse, reject or suspend without prior notification any End User who is suspected of cheating, hacking, attacking, manipulating or damaging the Operator's normal betting operations (including the Website). Any of the "abnormal bets" will be void without prior notification. The use of artificial intelligence or "bots" on the Website is strictly forbidden. The Operator will take measures to prevent and detect programmes that are used to enable artificial intelligence (non human) to utilise the Website. Any attempted or actual use of artificial intelligence by the End User to cheat, hack, attack, manipulating or damage the Operator's betting operations will lead to termination of their account and/or voiding the bets, at the discretion of the Operator.</p>
